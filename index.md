### CPSC120

* Lab 03 Part 2

This lab was interesting because it had a lot of separate parts with the introduction of functions that made me feel like I had accomplished something early on. Using functions helped make it more concise but also felt more substantial. The final output of the program had some actual utility as well.

* Lab 06 Part 2

This one was interesting in a similar way to Lab 03. Using functions made the code look both clean and readable, yet decently complex. Splitting up the files into main, functions, and the function header was also interesting because it showed how multiple files can kind of interact with each other.

* Lab 12 Part 1

I liked this one because we were able to use math to create a moving image. I thought that the way a sine function could create a phasing effect and overlaying three separate moving images looked interesting. It was also cool to see how we could create an outer loop for each frame, and then two other nested loops for the rows and columns of the pixels in each frame.
